                                The Center for Responsive Politics /also known as OpenSecrets\ allows their data to be accessed via API /Application Programming Interface\ calls.
                            Users that register for this feature are allowed access and are given API keys that are used for authorization purposes when calling the data through Javascript.
                            The API documentation listed on the opensecrets.org website provides a variety of functions that return different data depending on what a user may need.
                            In our case, the following methods were used:
                        </p>
                        <!-- <ul class="doc_list">
                            <lh>the getLegislators method is essentially the most general function, and returns a list of current Congress legislators and representatives associated for each state.</lh>
                            <li>getLegislators</li>
                            <li>candContrib</li>
                            <li>candIndustry</li>
                            <li>candSummary</li>
                        </ul> -->
                        <p>
                            As for the rest of the functions, their method names are offer a fairly concise, if not vague, description of what they return.
                            The Contrib function returns the top contributors to a candidate for the indicated period /sourced from https://www.opensecrets.org/open-data/api-documentation\.
                            The Industry funbction return the top industries to a candidate for the indicated period /sourced from https://www.opensecrets.org/open-data/api-documentation\.
                            he Summary function returns summary contribution on a candidate for the indicated period /Guess where this was sourced from?\.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After making the API calls and getting JSON objects in return, we sorted through them and pulled out the important bits that were to be displayed along with our map.
