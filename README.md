The purpose of thie project is to emphsaize transparency in politics, specifically regarding legislative funding.
Using an API offered by The Center for Responsive Politics, some important financial data about the representatives and senators of each state was consolidated into a map of the United States.
While this adaptation of the API does not cover an extensive field of political and financial data, it does cover several potentially useful aspects, such as general financial data as well as the top industries that support a given representative/senator.
This project is unlikely to provide any groundbreaking insight into a politician's financial activity, but it may serve as a point of reference when thinking about who is deserving of voter support.
Clicking on a state within the condensed map will display API data which was adapted and gathered into relevant points.
